# Welcome!
Here is where I want to make data analysis available to DJs.
Many of these notebooks are on google Colab so you can run the notebooks on your own data. You'll have to click through some agreements if it's your first time. 

Start by viewing the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ThomasMAhern/WCS_playlist_analysis/blob/main/notebooks/WCS_playlist_analysis.ipynb) of BPM graphs of assorted playlists - you can't interact with this one, but you can with the ones below.

Please reach out if you need help running the notebooks below. It can be confusing to look at at first, but it's well worth the hassle!


## If you want to see the BPM graphs on your own playlist(s), try this notebook: 
[Playlist BPM Grapher](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11E7wQ6Ccf2CFu5vbWURZbT3i7vYaNZJJ?usp=sharing)!

## If you want to see popular music you dont have, or music that's unique to you, try: 
[Playlists and DJs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w75Xg6p-nT_67vZx14HUDe91RD2Mo8gN?usp=sharing) notebook:
