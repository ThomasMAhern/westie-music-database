# Welcome!

Probably easiest if you start by viewing the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ThomasMAhern/WCS_playlist_analysis/blob/main/notebooks/WCS_playlist_analysis.ipynb) to view the graphs.

If you want to run it on your own playlist, try this [Playlist BPM Grapher](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11E7wQ6Ccf2CFu5vbWURZbT3i7vYaNZJJ?usp=sharing)!
